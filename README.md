# AudioQuantViz

A simple toolkit for visualizing audio signal quantization and digitization concepts.

## Overview

AudioQuantViz provides tools to generate, quantize, and visualize audio signals to help understand concepts in digital signal processing. This project is useful for:

- Students learning digital audio processing
- Teachers demonstrating quantization concepts
- Audio engineers visualizing quantization effects
- Anyone interested in understanding how analog signals become digital

## Features

- Generate pure sine waves and other test signals
- Apply different levels of quantization (bit depth reduction)
- Visualize original and quantized waveforms
- Calculate and display quantization error
- Compare multiple quantization levels simultaneously

## Installation

```bash
